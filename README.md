# Venue Ticketing System

A venue booking ticketing system, modelled on the Glasgow Life website, which allows the owner to sell tickets to customers.

### Built with:

- Java - object orientated programming language
- JUnit - unit testing framework
- IntelliJ - IDE


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this web app, you will need to have:
- IntelliJ
- SDK version 9.0

### Installing

1. Open IntelliJ
2. Open venue_booking_system project


## Motivation

This web app was created as part of a project undertaken while attending CodeClan's 16-week intensive course. At the beginning of the week, we were given four briefs to choose from in which we would implement, consolidate and expand on everything we'd learnt so far.

This included:

- Java fundamentals
- TDD
- OOP
- SOLID principles

Having recently had a bad UX on a ticketing site, I decided to create my own.


## Brief

The Venue must be able to:

* Make a Ticket sale
  - The customer funds go down, venue sales go up

The Customer must:

* Have a collection of possible Payment Methods:
 - CreditCard (default), DebitCard
* Be able to select a Payment Method to pay at any Venue
* Be able to select a Payment Method to receive a refund onto a given Payment Method
(You may find HashMaps useful for this project)
